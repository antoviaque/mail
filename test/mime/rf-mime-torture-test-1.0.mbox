Welcome to Ryan Finnie's MIME torture test.  This message was designed
to introduce a couple of the newer features of MIME-aware MUAs, features
that have come around since the days of the original MIME torture test.

Just to be clear, this message SUPPLEMENTS the original torture test,
not replaces it.  The original test is still very much valid these days,
and new MUAs should strive to first pass the original test, then this
one.

By the way, the message/rfc822 parts have Content-Descriptions
containing Futurama quotes.  Bonus points if the MUA display these
somewhere.

Have fun!

Ryan Finnie

While a message/rfc822 part inside another message/rfc822 part in a

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In this message's attachment, the Content-Disposition has a
filename of blah1.gz, while the Content-Type has a name of
blah2.gz.  What should be done?  Well, since this is an attachment
(as indicated in the Content-Disposition), the MUA should
suggest a filename of blah1.gz.  The MUA *COULD* find a way to
represent the name of blah2.gz somewhere else, it's not needed.

Content-Type: text/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When searching for a suitable name to suggest for a filename,
the MUA should probably follow this order.  First, look for
Content-Disposition's filename attribute.  If that is missing,
look for Content-Type's file attribute.  If that is also missing,
I would recomment taking the Content-Description, stripping off
any characters that cannot be used in a filename, and suggesting
that.

If none of those fields are available, the MUA could just make
up a random filename.  SOMETHING is better than nothing.

Wow, what a complicated message.  This message is laid out as so:

multipart/signed
| multipart/mixed
| | mutipart/related
| | | multipart/alternative
| | | | text/plain
| | | | text/html
| | | image/png (smiley)
| | image/gif (dot)
| application/pgp-signature

:)

A smiley face should be embedded into the HTML part above (if you are
viewing the HTML part), while the red square dot should be attached, not
displayed inline.  Additionally, this whole message is PGP signed.

This message introduces a few tricks that the MUA should cope with.=20
First of all, the related / alternative combination doesn't make much
sense.  Here's the current setup in pseudo-code:

relationship between (alternative: HTML or text part) and PNG part

Why would the text part be related in anyway to the PNG?  Instead, the
correct and more logical way to do things would be:

alternative: (relationship between HTML and PNG parts) or text part

However, many MUAs compose a message using the first method, so this
should be taken care of when parsing the message.

Additionally, notice that the inline image has a disposition of
"attachment".  Despite this being in there, the smiley should be
embedded inline in the HTML part, not offered as an attachment.=20
Conversely, the GIF image should be offered as an attachment, not
displayed inline.

If the MUA is not PGP capable, at the very least it should recognize
multipart/signed the same as multipart/mixed, and offer the
application/pgp-signature part as an attachment.

If this sentence is green, you're viewing the HTML part.

Now, this is the way that all MUAs SHOULD treat this kind of situation. 
The layout is like so:

multipart/alternative
| text/plain
| multipart/related
| | text/html
| | image/gif

See?  The GIF (which by the way should be inline towards the top of this
message) is related to the HTML, and that whole block is an alternative
to a text/plain part.  This is the opposite of the way shown in the
previous email.

Also, the embedded image here does not have a filename.  As mentioned
above, the MUA should suggest something as a filename, even here (the
user may want to save the embedded image, so a filename would be
helpful).  In this case, I would recommend appending the random text
to be suggested to the user with the part's subtype, in this case
something like c20vsidlkvm.gif.
